    ** read **
       ----
       send read command, expect answer with select for 5 seconds,
       if silent, send read again. If 3 reads fail, bail out.

       if read succeeds, repeat again to get the same result
       if 5 reads don't get 2 same in succession, bail out

    ** write **
       -----
       send write command, expect confirmation result with select
       for 5 seconds, if silent sand again, 3 silent reads bail out

       upon successful write, call read procedure to verify written.
       try to write and verify 3 times to get correct reading otherwise
       bail out.
